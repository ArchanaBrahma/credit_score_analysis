**Problem Statement**

Financial institutions need accurate credit scoring systems to assess a customer’s creditworthiness and reduce the risk of loan defaults. Traditional methods are often slow and rule-based, lacking predictive power.

**Objective**
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts customer credit scores based on financial and demographic data, enabling faster and more reliable credit risk assessment.

 **Dataset**

Financial and demographic customer data

Includes features such as:

Income

Age

Credit history

Loan-related attributes

Target variable: Credit Score Category

**Data Preprocessing**
To ensure high-quality input data, the following steps were performed:

Handling missing values

Label encoding for categorical variables

Feature engineering to improve model performance

Scaling numerical features where required

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

EDA was conducted to understand data patterns and relationships:

Distribution analysis of financial attributes

Correlation analysis between features

Identification of key variables influencing credit score

Visualization using plots and charts for insights

**Machine Learning Models**

Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest (best-performing model)

Model comparison using evaluation metrics

**Model Evaluation**
Models were evaluated using:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Classification metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

The best-performing model was selected based on overall performance and generalization capability.

**Results**

Achieved strong predictive accuracy

Identified key financial factors affecting credit scores

Built a reliable model for credit risk prediction

**Model Deployment**

Saved the trained model using a pipeline

Enabled real-time predictions for new customer data

Designed for easy integration into production systems

**Business Impact**

Helps banks and financial institutions assess credit risk efficiently

Reduces loan default probability

Supports automated and data-driven decision-making

**Tech Stack**

Programming: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Future Enhancements**
Deploy the model using Streamlit or Flask

Improve performance using ensemble techniques

Incorporate additional financial indicators
